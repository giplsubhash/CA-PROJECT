<p align="justify">An LLP company must submit its Annual Returns and Account Statements using two separate forms, namely Form 11 and Form 8, on an annual basis. These submissions need to be completed 60 days prior to the end of the financial year. It is paramount to prioritize annual compliance for an LLP company, as consistent reporting significantly enhances the company's credibility, particularly in situations involving conversion or closure. These annual reports establish the company's financial stability, which can attract larger projects and potential investors. Timely filing is crucial to maintain the company's active status and avoid substantial financial penalties.</p>
