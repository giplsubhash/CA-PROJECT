<p align="justify">Nidhi companies primarily engage in borrowing and lending among their members. As non-banking financial entities, they are exempt from adhering to the Companies Act, 2013, and are governed by the guidelines of the Nidhi Company Act, 2014. Annual compliance for Nidhi companies requires the mandatory submission of NDH-1, NDH-2, and NDH-3 applications, along with legal actions. Neglecting these requirements can result in imprisonment and fines of up to Rs. 5000.</p>
