<p align="justify">In India, there is a distressingly high number of fire-related incidents leading to avoidable loss of life, with approximately 25,000 cases reported annually. Many businesses have suffered catastrophic consequences, including structural failures, due to negligence of safety measures and non-compliance with established regulations. However, obtaining a state-issued fire license can serve as a preventive measure against such disasters by ensuring that business premises are fire-resistant and unlikely to pose a fire risk.</p>
<br>
<p align="justify">In order to secure a fire license, applicants need to meet particular prerequisites established by the state fire department concerning their business establishment. These stipulations can differ from one state to another, and in West Bengal, the issuance of fire licenses is regulated by the West Bengal Fire Service Act of 1950.</p>
<br>
<p align="justify">To obtain a fire license, applicants must meet specific requirements set by the state fire department for their business establishment. These requirements can vary from one state to another. In West Bengal, the issuance of fire licenses is governed by the West Bengal Fire Service Act of 1950.</p>
<br>
<p align="justify">According to this law, buildings with a height exceeding 14.5 meters are subject to fire safety regulations, aimed at ensuring effective safeguards and preventing fire-related incidents. These regulations are endorsed by both the Deputy Director of Fire Services and the Director-General of Fire and Emergency Services.

Structures measuring 14.5 meters or higher are subject to fire safety regulations under the WB Fire Service Act of 1950, ensuring their proper maintenance and protection against potential fire-related incidents. Approval for this license is granted by both the Deputy Director of Fire Services and the Director-General of Fire and Emergency Services. </p><br>
