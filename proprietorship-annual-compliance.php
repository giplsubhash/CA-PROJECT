<p align="justify">Proprietorship businesses are widely adopted in India, particularly by aspiring entrepreneurs, due to their simplicity and reduced legal requirements. In this structure, a single individual owns, manages, and oversees the business, requiring lower capital investment. Annual compliance for proprietorship entities typically involves the submission of the company's annual financial statement, as well as the proprietor's GST and Income Tax returns. If the proprietor is registered for GST, monthly GST returns are also mandatory. Neglecting these responsibilities may result in penalties.</p>
