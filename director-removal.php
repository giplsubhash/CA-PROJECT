<p align="justify">As per the guidelines outlined in the Companies Act of 2013, the responsibility for the removal of a director from a company rests with the board of directors. However, this step necessitates a valid and compelling reason. Reasons for the removal encompass factors like the director's ineffectiveness, involvement in fraudulent actions, directorial conflicts, or voluntary resignation owing to personal circumstances.</p>
<br>
<p align="justify">To proceed with the dismissal of a director, the board of directors is required to approve an Ordinary Resolution. This resolution should detail the grounds for removal and confirm that the director was not appointed by the central government. Once this authorized resolution is in place, the director can be officially removed from the company.</p>
