<p align="justify">If your business engages in activities that have the potential to generate pollutants, such as chemical waste production, detergent use, smoking, or medical waste disposal, it is crucial to obtain a pollution license from the pollution control board. The Central Pollution Control Board has categorized pollution into four distinct classes for regulation. The Red category includes large-scale manufacturing units, lodging and dining establishments, hospitals, and other sectors. The Orange category encompasses medium-sized companies with significant pollutant emissions. The Green category applies to businesses with relatively lower pollution levels, while the White category is associated with businesses causing minimal to no pollution.</p> <br>

<p align="justify">To gain a comprehensive understanding of Pollution License Registration, it is advisable to seek assistance from a legal expert who can provide guidance on complying with relevant laws and directives aimed at preserving the environment and protecting your business interests. Ensuring accurate registration and adherence to pollution control regulations is essential for both environmental preservation and the continued operational success of your company.</p>
